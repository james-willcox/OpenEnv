# OpenEnv
 An open-source environmental measurement system
 
 This system will allow anyone and everyone to submit environmental measurements they have taken into the database, to contribute to a world wide picture of our environment.  Have a weather station?  Hook it up to OpenEnv!  Taken a water sample of a local creek?  Send it to OpenEnv!  Help us build a picture of the world around us and carefully monitor the way it is changing
 
 The database schema is maintained and mapped in the OpenEnv.dbs file.  This is a DB schema file,
